Today, I am announcing full and total sanctions on Vietnam.

For far too long, they’ve manipulated their currency, abused our trade deals, and hurt American workers. That ends now.

Under my leadership, the United States will immediately halt all trade, financial, and technological cooperation with the Vietnamese government.

Nobody has ever been tougher on Vietnam than I have. America First — Always.

— Donald J. Trump
